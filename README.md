# nbutane_DPMD_project

This repository contains the input and log files used for the final project of the course Molecular modeling and simulations. The studied system is liquid n-butane at 1 atm, and 160, 200, 250, and 272 K. Files for simulations include an input for NPT and NVT simulations in lammps, AIMD simulations with CP2K, and input scripts for DeepMD-kit.
